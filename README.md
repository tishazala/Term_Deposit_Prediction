 Term_Deposit_Prediction
  Project Description

The Term_Deposit_Prediction project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from a bank marketing campaign to understand customer behavior and predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Banks run multiple marketing campaigns each year to promote their financial products — particularly term deposits. However, many campaigns are time-consuming, costly, and yield low conversion rates. This project helps identify which customers are most likely to respond positively based on their demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes.

Objective:-

To analyze bank marketing campaign data and develop insights that can:

Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Identify the key factors influencing a customer's decision.

Support banks in designing data-driven marketing strategies.

Reduce campaign costs while improving conversion rates.
